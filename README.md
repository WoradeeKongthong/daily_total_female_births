# daily_total_female_births  
This is a learning of how to use Deep Learning model in time series forecasting,  
following the 7 days mini course on "How to Get Started with Deep Learning for Time Series"  
from machinelearningmastery.com.  
https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-get-started-with-deep-learning-for-time-series-forecasting-7-day-mini-course/  

It comprises of forecasting using :  
  - MLP(Multiple Layers Perceptron),  
  - CNN(Convolutional Neural Network), 
  - LSTM(Long Short Term Merory),  
  - CNN-LSTM (combination of CNN and LSTM),  
  - Encoder-Decoder (for multiple steps forecasting)
